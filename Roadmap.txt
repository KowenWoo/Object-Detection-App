            app processes picture of a limb or some other group and labels every bones
            pros:

        Facial detection to work with smart lock system on a door
            pros:
                useful in every day lives
            cons: 
                may require engineering to integrate software into a smart lock system
        Unique person detection to monitor busy-ness in a building 
            pros:
                very diverse application (study spots, businesses, gym. etc.)
