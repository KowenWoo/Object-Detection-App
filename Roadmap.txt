General direction and goals for project

app idea: Object detection of human bones to help anatomy and physiology students study 
        app processes picture of a limb or some other group and labels every bone
        eventually add functionality to also label features of bones and contribution to larger structure in drow down menu

Onboarding stuff:
    fill out questionnaire - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cGdQlANm9xN4Ykoe5W9QyF55gjFoxqnxM5yJD7bvSvI/edit?usp=sharing
    download github (shared code repository for version control)
        optional: download sourcetree - GUI for github to visualize app history (easier to use than command line)
    download pytorch and dependencies - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
        Dependencies:
            python 3.11.8 or older - https://www.python.org/downloads/
            anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download
    download flutter and dependencies - https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
    work log: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AcwX59t93Uj1tkhJ6Edy7vzg9h7ID05o0EdRkH3FNDc/edit?usp=sharing
    
areas to work on:
    data collection and analysis (no programming experience required)
        find datasets via research papers with readily available annotated pictures 
        if none compile images from textbooks, diagrams, etc.
    UI/UX using flutter (front end - some programming experience required, will have to learn dart regardless)
        decide on UI direction and layout
        implement efficiency and usability in UX
        use dummy pytorch model as placeholder for neural network
    neural network model (back end - most programming heavy aspect)
        learn pytorch 
        familiarize with sample object detection on pytorch docs
        use sample object detection with our datasets
        training neural network
        implementing neural network into UI/UX
